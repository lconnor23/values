# Choose Your Values App

Live site [here](https://knowyourvalues.netlify.app/)

This project was built for a therapist client who wanted a resource for their clients. The user can see a list of values, click through to read the descriptions of that value, and select the ones that most resonate with them.

## Built With
React
Next
TailwindCSS

## Optimizations
I'm currently working on optimizing the styling on this site. Another page will be added that displays all the selected values along with more information about them, journaling prompts, etc. Another feature I would like to have is the ability to drag and sort the values into different categories.

## Lessons Learned
Next.js 13 was wonderful to work with the new app directory. I also learned to fetch data from my json file in the api folder. I needed to use state so I wasn't able to take advantage of the new server-side components, but I look forward to using them on future projects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
